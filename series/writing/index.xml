      <title>Another Midnight Stroll</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not want to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home, I do not want to be at home.  I feel unwanted.  I feel alone.  I give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry.  I do not want to eat alone.  I do not want to watch tv, youtube, or scroll through twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I annoy you.  I bother you.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want this. I know that to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take care of me.  So does your mother&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be taken care of.  I want to be left alone.   Until, I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want to have sex with you.  I tried.  I forced it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to have sex with you.  You avoid me.  You must know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know any better.  I know this cycle.  It ends only in my own destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to destroy myself.  Cut my hair. Read a book about the tao.  Pretend to be a monk.  Justify my goodness with these weird ascetic actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to watch disgusting porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to have an affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to want these things.  I do.  I submit. I submit. I submit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will die.  Pain does not justify my existence.  It does not enhance it.  It does not make me a better man than any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to run until I die. Until, my body can no longer move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final thought.  I create these thoughts.  I can feel within me a better way.  I am attracted to it, but I do not trust myself to follow.  If I accept it. If I submit.  I will die.  What point is there in creating oneself?  What results is always just a hollow counter reaction to whatever is in vogue.  I do not know what I am, but I am not that.  Oh yes, you are that.  I am a disgusting human being.  I am tempted to do the most atrocious things imaginable.  I refuse accept it.  I refuse, to cooperate in my own best intereset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch porn, I feel guilt.  I box, I feel like an idiot.  I smoke a cigarette, I feel foolish. I buy coffee, I feel manipulated.  I have sex, I feel empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I feel like a teenage boy experiencing sex for the first time.  I feel like a child questioning the rules set by his parents.   Like a brat confessing to Le Monsignor. And yet, I cannot overcome these innate insecurities.  I am aware. I will not overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Washington Avenue</title>
      <link>https://notebook.jnapolitano.io/posts/washington-avenue/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, a cigarette.  Relief.  Immediate relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work.  Pretend to be a profesional.  Write a post.   Act like an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know a thing.  I take an interview. I am too honest.  I tell the truth.  I express my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You speak to me.  I listen.  Your questions are pointless.  I do not care about your company.  I do not really care about your product.  I want a job to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so simple.  I want my paycheck.  I want to pay rent.  I want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife works.  I drink coffee.  I write a post.  I justify my day.  I return home.  I watch tv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I strolled.  I walked the avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men.  Three of them approahced.  Three of them left confused.  Do not move. Do not speak.  Breathe slowly.  Walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cigarettes.  I do not want to be here.  Another smoke to fit in.  Washington Avenue.  Houston.  The crowd waiting to enter a dirty room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lonliness is hell. A cigarette is death.  Die to avoid being alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk the avenue.  Breathe.  Return home.  Turn on the tv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still walk with fear.  An insecure gait.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starbucks Coffee</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;objects-and-identity&#34; &gt;Objects and Identity
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#objects-and-identity&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am looking at myself.  I feel the weave of my woolen pants.  The gold and blue and black threads interweave to produce a cacoon for my pale legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel confident.  I feel comfortable.  I may not be a large man. I am not the smartest; nor strongest.  Yet, I feel well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small aesthetic things produce a positive impression. My red hankerchief accompanying a matching outfit.  A perfectly cut fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boots.  Leather boots.  I feel steady when I wear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety affects me more than it used to.  I think about things.  I used to just do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man should carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad told me to just ignore the bullshit.  To focus on what is important.  General lack of meaning and purpose is painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still attempt to find truth and reason in why I do the things I do.  I read a solution to the problem once. Submit. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, one can create their identity.  Society etches her identity in to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not believe in God.  I ask him for help to get out of bed.  I rationalize it away as a fear response.  Mother Mary laughs from the chain around my neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I experienced death she stood by me in the room.  Watching over my body as it descended into death.  I survived.  She is no longer with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drink my coffee.  Starbucks brand.  I feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
