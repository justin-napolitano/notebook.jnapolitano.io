Ah, a cigarette.  Relief.  Immediate relief. 

Work.  Pretend to be a profesional.  Write a post.   Act like an expert.  

I do not know a thing.  I take an interview. I am too honest.  I tell the truth.  I express my doubts.  

You speak to me.  I listen.  Your questions are pointless.  I do not care about your company.  I do not really care about your product.  I want a job to live.  

It is so simple.  I want my paycheck.  I want to pay rent.  I want to eat.  

My wife works.  I drink coffee.  I write a post.  I justify my day.  I return home.  I watch tv.  

Tonight, I strolled.  I walked the avenue.


Men.  Three of them approahced.  Three of them left confused.  Do not move. Do not speak.  Breathe slowly.  Walk away.  


Cigarettes.  I do not want to be here.  Another smoke to fit in.  Washington Avenue.  Houston.  The crowd waiting to enter a dirty room.  

Lonliness is hell. A cigarette is death.  Die to avoid being alone.  

Walk the avenue.  Breathe.  Return home.  Turn on the tv.  

I still walk with fear.  An insecure gait.
