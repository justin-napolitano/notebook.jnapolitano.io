## Objects and Identity

I am looking at myself.  I feel the weave of my woolen pants.  The gold and blue and black threads interweave to produce a cacoon for my pale legs.  

I feel confident.  I feel comfortable.  I may not be a large man. I am not the smartest; nor strongest.  Yet, I feel well.  

The small aesthetic things produce a positive impression. My red hankerchief accompanying a matching outfit.  A perfectly cut fade.  

Boots.  Leather boots.  I feel steady when I wear them.

Social anxiety affects me more than it used to.  I think about things.  I used to just do them. 
 
A man should carry on.  

My dad told me to just ignore the bullshit.  To focus on what is important.  General lack of meaning and purpose is painful.

I still attempt to find truth and reason in why I do the things I do.  I read a solution to the problem once. Submit. So it goes.  

Supposedly, one can create their identity.  Society etches her identity in to me.

I do not believe in God.  I ask him for help to get out of bed.  I rationalize it away as a fear response.  Mother Mary laughs from the chain around my neck.  

When I experienced death she stood by me in the room.  Watching over my body as it descended into death.  I survived.  She is no longer with me.  

Drink my coffee.  Starbucks brand.  I feel better.
