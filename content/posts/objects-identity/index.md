## Objects and Identity

I am looking at myself.  I feel the weave of my woolen pants.  The gold and blue and black threads interweave to produce a cacoon for my pale legs.  

I feel confident.  I feel comfortable.  I may not be a large man. I am not the smartest; nor strongest.  Yet, I feel well.  

The small aesthetic things produce a positive impression. My red hankerchief accompanying a matching outfit.  A perfectly cut fade.  

Boots.  Leather boots.  They deserve their own paragraph.  I love my boots. I feel steady when I wear them.

Social anxiety affects me more than it used to.  I think about things.  I used to just do them. 

I want a cappucino.  He thinks I'm a fag.  I like that film.  He's too sentimental.  I don't want to drive.  He must be socialist.  

A man should carry on.  

I let the associations of other men determine my preferences.  The objects, well their social associations mean something to somebody.  To me, well I watched a few films.  I read a few books.  I idolized somebody.  I guess, I still do. 

My dad told me to just ignore the bullshit.  To focus on what is important.  General lack of meaning and purpose is painful.  Women.  Maybe women.  No, never women.

I still attempt to find truth and reason in why I do the things I do.  I read a solution to the problem once.  So it goes.  

Supposedly, one can create their identity.  Society etches her identity in to me.
to me.  

I do not believe in God.  I ask him for help to get out of bed.  I rationalize it away as a fear response.  Mother Mary laughs from the chain around my neck.  

When I experienced death she stood by me in the room.  Watching over my body as it descended into death.  I survived.  She is no longer with me.  

Drink my coffee.  Starbucks brand.  I feel better.
