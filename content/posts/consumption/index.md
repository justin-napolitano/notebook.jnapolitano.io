## Consumption

I do not like myself.  I do not like watching youtube.  I do not like reading blogs.  I do not like television.  I do not like advertisement. 

I watched 5 hours of youtube.  I masturbated twice.  I had two coffees.  I ate a duck, half a chicken, and an acre of grain.e

It doesn't feel right. 

I want to be able to do without caring.  To be able to fuck, drink, smoke, and kill without a thought.  To be hard.  

I cannot do it.  

A man does not care.  A man is true.  A man does what he must.  He carries on.

I am not such a man.  Everything hurts.  I am tired.  I am in pain.  I want to die.   I am afraid to sleep.  I am weak.  Women disgust me.  Men scare me.  

Death smiled at me.  He embraced me with his blade.  He only cut halfway through.  

I still stand.  Somehow I walk, I talk, I breathe.  I step forward to live.

I live behind a computer screen.  I sit and type.  I sit and read.  I sit and consume sex, smoke, and mirrors. 

I wanted to live.  Now, I disgrace myself with filth  I accepted it for a time.  I am broke.  I am dependent.  I am sick.  

I hate it.  I cannot liberate myself from all of it.  I cannot truly be free.  Decay will come.  It is already here.  

I will carry on.  I will die.  Not today, but some day.
