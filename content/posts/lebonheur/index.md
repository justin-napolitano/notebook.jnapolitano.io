## Le Bonheur

### The music.  The poetry.  The stills.  

Pastels.  Mozart.  Yellow.  Blue.  Red. Green.  Temptation.  Fidelity.

Moments and words.  Colors and music.  I can not process the barrage of sensation.


### Emilie

Emilie a woman.  Emilie a danseur.  Emilie a lover.  Blonde and petite.  Expressive and honest.  She owns nothing.  She lives alone.  


### The Wife 

The wife is traditional, disciplined, caring.  She cooks.  She sews.  She fucks.     

### The Man

The man, a man.  Beautiful man.  Tall, dark, handsome.  A carpenter, always well dressed and well mannered.  Joyous without fail.  He loves his wife.  He loves his children.  He loves his mistress.  He loves his nephews.  He loves his uncle.

He is too perfect.  Too beautiful  He is the epitome of mascuinity demonstrating the tenderness of a poet.  A man that works with his manicured hands.  A man that crosses his legs to sip tea from blue china.  He dances.  He is good in bed. He is honest.  


### Death

We experience death.  We dissasociate from the hell of that moment.  The yellows shift to blue.  The wife embraced.  Cold and drowned.  Music ceases. 

Family mourns. Family cries.  Man visits his beauty to secure a place within her memory.  

A post card, Black and white.  Emptiness without a woman.  Color fades to grey.  


### Love

The return.  The embrace.  The invitation.  The acceptance.

Music begins.  Love is made.  Emilie, mistress, mother, wife, lover. 


Holding hands they march towards the future away from the countryside.  A death of tradition to embrace the temptation of an engaging wife. Equal to men in her proclivity for love and her breadth of emotion.  

### Compromise
There is more to the film than nihilism.  Emilie, I love her too.  Emilie a social being.  A woman with an identity of her own.  Possibly a blank state that can create her existence.  

Yet, she marries.  That independent identity becomes a part of a family.  Though, a family embracing with hands held and feet on the ground.  Independent nodes of being linked together by the common experience.  A fair compromise to femininity and independence, love, and biology.
