## Le Bonheur

The music.  The poetry.  The stills.  

The beauty of this film haunts me.  Pastels.  Mozart.  Yello.  Blue.  Red. Green.  Temptation.  Fidelity.

Moments and words.  Colors and music.  I can not process the barrage of sensation.

A man in love.  A wife loving.  A mistress tempting.   

The death of his wife.  His remarriage.  Children calling another women mother.  Emilie a woman  Emilie a danseur.  Emilie a mother.  

The wife.  Traditional.  Hard working.  Caring.  She cooks.  She sews.  She permits she husband to do as he pleases.  

The man, a man.  Beautiful man.  Tall, dark, handsome.  Rugged, to a degree.  A carpenter, always well dressed and well mannered.  Joyous without fail.  He loves his wife.  he loves his children.  He loves his mistress.  He loves his nephews.  He loves his uncle.

He loves everything.  He is too perfect.  Too beautiful  He is the epitome of mascuinity demonstrating the tenderness of a poet.  A man that works with his manicured hands.  A man that crosses his lefs to sip tea from blue china.  He dances.  He is good in bed. 


We experience death.  We dissasociate from the hell of that moment.  The yellows shift to blue.  The wife embraced.  Cold and drowned.  Music ceases.

Family mourns. Family cries.  Man visits his beauty to secure a place within her memory.  

A post card, Black and white.  Emptiness withouth a woman.  Color fades to grey.  

The return.  The embrace.  The invitation.  The acceptance.

Music begins.  Love is made.  Emilie, mistress, mother, wife, lover. 

Holding hands marching towards the future.  A death of tradition to embrace the temptation of an engaging wife. Equal to men in her proclivity for love and her breadth of emotion.  

Ophelia drowned clutching the flowers near the pond to be forgotten by family she once loved.  

Horrifying is the personal experience of death.  It passes on with the coldness of time.  This is how it is.  

There is more to the film than nihilism.  Emilie, I love her too.  Emilie a social being.  A woman with an identity of her own.  Possibly a blank state that can create her existence.  

Yet, she marries.  That independent identity becomes a part of a family.  Though, a we embracing with hands held and feet on the ground.  Independent nodes of being linked together by the common experience.  A fair compromise to femininity and independence, love, and biology.
