## Anxiety

Anxiety is the most destructive emotion.  It feels as if death itself has taken a hold of me.  I cannot deviate from the path dictated by the sensation of that moment.  I do not like it.  I do not want to experience, but I cannot yet find a way to overcome it.  

The solution is to do what god asks.  To do what is right.  But I cannot find that peace.  I give in.  I submit to it.  Please god help me forward.  Please give me strength because I am a weak weak weak man.  In every way, I am a child.  A naive boy attempting to be a man.  Please lord give me the strength to carry on.
