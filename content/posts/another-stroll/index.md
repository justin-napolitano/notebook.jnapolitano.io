I do not want to be here.  

Home, I do not want to be at home.  I feel unwanted.  I feel alone.  I give up. 

I am sorry.  I do not want to eat alone.  I do not want to watch tv, youtube, or scroll through twitter.  

I annoy you.  I bother you.  I don't know.  

I don't want this. I know that to be true. 

You take care of me.  So does your mother

I don't want to be taken care of.  I want to be left alone.   Until, I don't.  

I do not want to have sex with you.  I tried.  I forced it.  

I want to have sex with you.  You avoid me.  You must know.  

I do not know any better.  I know this cycle.  It ends only in my own destruction. 

I want to destroy myself.  Cut my hair. Read a book about the tao.  Pretend to be a monk.  Justify my goodness with these weird ascetic actions.   

I want a cigarette.

I want to watch disgusting porn. 

I want to have an affair.  

I don't want to want these things.  I do.  I submit. I submit. I submit.  

I will die.  Pain does not justify my existence.  It does not enhance it.  It does not make me a better man than any other. 

I want to run until I die. Until, my body can no longer move. 

Final thought.  I create these thoughts.  I can feel within me a better way.  I am attracted to it, but I do not trust myself to follow.  If I accept it. If I submit.  I will die.  What point is there in creating oneself?  What results is always just a hollow counter reaction to whatever is in vogue.  I do not know what I am, but I am not that.  Oh yes, you are that.  I am a disgusting human being.  I am tempted to do the most atrocious things imaginable.  I refuse accept it.  I refuse, to cooperate in my own best intereset.  

I watch porn, I feel guilt.  I box, I feel like an idiot.  I smoke a cigarette, I feel foolish. I buy coffee, I feel manipulated.  I have sex, I feel empty.  

As I write this, I feel like a teenage boy experiencing sex for the first time.  I feel like a child questioning the rules set by his parents.   Like a brat confessing to Le Monsignor. And yet, I cannot overcome these innate insecurities.  I am aware. I will not overcome.
