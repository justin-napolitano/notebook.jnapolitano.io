&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Organizations are vital to the operation of International
politics. They regulate behaviors, facilitate communication, and promote
cooperation between states. The process by which International
Organizations come into being is well discussed in the literature,
however, not equally well debated is the process by which International
Organizations come to modify their operating procedure. Or in other
words, when the member states renegotiate the terms of their membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Waltz argues that domestic politics is irrelevant to the
calculus of states. He argues primarily that states act according to the
actions of other states. The bureaucracy, the public, and the legal
systems are all factors not considered in his framework. He does however
take the position that &amp;ldquo;politics determines economics (Waltz 2010)&amp;rdquo;, but
does not further his sociological analyses. In other words, he accepts
that the behavior of states is derive from the socially constructed
political process, but does not analyze human systems to other than the
state when attempting to predict state behavior. (Waltz 2010)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Keohane builds upon Waltz. He takes the assumption that there are
inherent common interests between states seeking wealth and power, and
the maximization of absolute gains. States are then presumed to possess
preferences dependent on the division of resources and information
within the international system. To accomplish goals and to minimize
insecurity states then cooperate by forming international regimes
defined to be, &amp;ldquo;sets of implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules,
and decision-making procedures around which actor&amp;rsquo;s expectations
converge in a given area of international relations&amp;rdquo; (Keohane, 2005, p
57). In bargaining for international trade deals, states seek to
maximize power and wealth for all states involved in the process.
(Keohane, 2005)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearon also adopts this position, however also assumes that states seek
when bargaining the maximization of gains across time. Therefore the
logic of the iterated prisoners dilemma is used to explain cooperation.
Because of the shadow of the future, or the expectations of further
interaction between states, the most rational choice to maximize gains
across time is for states to cooperate and to normalize rules in the
form of a legalistic International Organizations. (Fearon 1998)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moravsic adopts a liberal stance, breaking from the neorealist, as well
as the regime theorist position that the factors of the international
system determines state behavior. He argues that the preferences of
powerful coalitions within states and the combined societal will to
carry them out are the basis for state behavior. His theory rests upon
three core assumptions. 1. State actors primarily define state
preference. 2. Domestic institutions and their structure exert influence
on the realization of coalition preferences. 3. &amp;ldquo;The configuration of
interdependent state preferences determines state behavior (Moravsic,
1997).&amp;rdquo; Thus, powerful social coalitions pressure representative
governments, controlling for regime type, to bargain on the behalf of
their interests in the international game. This &amp;ldquo;two stage model&amp;rdquo; of
state behavior accounts for both regime theorist and realist
assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putnam further formulizes the process with the application of the
two-level game metaphor (1988). Level 1 is considered the domestic game
played by representative leaders to appease the domestic interests of
individuals, groups, and political coalitions. Level 2 is the
international game in which states compete to appease domestic
posturing. The win-set, the possible set of actions considered
acceptable to both the domestic coalition and the international
coalition, is dependent upon three major factors. 1. The distribution of
power, preferences, and possible coalitions among level 2 constituents.
2. The size of the representative body of political institutions. 3. The
strategies of the level 1 negotiators. The net effect of the three
limiting factors results in a win-set most probable to be ratified by
the domestic institutions. In other words, representatives bargaining on
behalf of powerful domestic coalitions must negotiate trade packages
acceptable to their domestic handlers. To apply principal-agent theory
to the intuition, the coalitions are the principle handling the
representative, their agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahl&amp;rsquo;s work on bureaucratic politics and policy networks within the city
of New Haven Connecticut is the foundation on which I will build to
identify the process of preferences becoming the action of a state. The
basis of his argument rests on the fact that certain actors possess the
authority to draft and to pass legislation. The units are the most
important actors within the policy network. All of those actors that
depend on the actor with authority must lobby to institute policy. The
power of the policy network is defined by their expertise, their social
standing, and their ability to satisfy the interests of the person or
persons in positions of authority. Depending on the issue at hand and
those actors mobilized the policy network is highly dynamic. (Dahl,
2005); (Dahl, 1957)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finnemore explores the ways in which international institutions acquire
a degree of autonomy and then may influence the states in the system by
creating rules and regulation to serve the interests of the organization
itself. Her work relies heavily on sociological analysis of human
systems. At both the international level and the domestic level of
politics Finnemore&amp;rsquo;s work argues that as organizations are comprised of
social actors the legal and social rules by which the institutions
operate by serve primarily to benefit the preservation of the group.
However, their legitimacy is dependent upon &amp;ldquo;external recognition&amp;rdquo; by
those ruled over (Finnemore 1999). In order, then to retain authority
and legitimacy, the government bureaucracy must development effective
methods of socialization to convince the public of its legitimacy.
Scaled up to International Organizations bureaucratic legitimacy is
equally dependent upon external validity. But as states are the only
units capable of effectively providing that validity, International
Organizations are wholly dependent on powerful states to enforce norms.
(Finnemore 1999); (Finnemore 1993); Finnemore 2001)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#theoretical-intuition&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately one must put forth a state centric argument in order to best
explain the operation of International Organizations and the
International System more generally. This heart of this paper will rest
on the assumption that the state as an organization is most responsible
for influencing the character of the International System, and
ultimately the modification of International Organizations. It does not
however, assume the state to be a rational entity capable of responding
to external stimuli in a way that maximizes its gains. Rather, as all
states depend on domestic legitimacy in order to exist, states
ultimately operate in order to appease the demands of powerful domestic
constituencies, often without regard to the actions of other states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of state can be thought of as a pyramidal hierarchy built
upon increasing levels of authority within the state. The base of which
is comprised of all of those people without any employment by the state.
Moving up from there may be civil servants of the state bureaucracy.
Ultimately the pinnacle of which is the institution or institutions
responsible for the management of all lower levels. The most important
factor binding the structure is legitimacy as each level is inherently
dependent on the external recognition of its legitimacy by the levels
beneath it. For instance, the Executive of the United States is
essentially without power, except for that power which is recognized
Congress and by extension the general public. A similar argument example
could be drawn for the military, the police, or any other institution
within a state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual codification of this social process is by definition the law
of a state. It may be thought of as the enforcement mechanism by which
the social structure is maintained and behavior standardized. Those
within the state with the authority to create law are those with the
power to socially reinforce their position of authority.[1] Thus it is
paramount that a leader once in a position of authority also has the
means of the state available to him in order to buttress his status.
Otherwise law will be ignored and the state will devolve into anarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the international the same processes occurs. Powerful states, be it
military power, or economic power, reinforce norms among weaker states
in order to standardize behavioral outcomes. Great state in of
themselves may be able to accomplish this by force, but the legitimacy
of those actions will always be perceived by lesser states as entirely
illegitimate. Unless a legal institution comprised of members is
developed in order to give the lesser states the appearance of
influence, all attempts to institute norms from a position of absolute
power will surely fail. Hence the breakup of the English Empire. If
nations, with distinct identities from that of the hegemon are to be
managed a legal structure accepted to be legitimate must be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, International Organizations come into being. They are an attempt
to institute a legal order binding to member states in order to minimize
risk ultimately at the behest of powerful states. The process by which
weak states join the organization is straightforward. They do so because
the powerful coalitions within their state seek to acquire the resources
available to them when entering an International Organization. Such
states will adapt to the rules of the IO, but only to the extent that
the IO serves their interest. Otherwise they will refuse to join. Once
they have joined, they will recognize the legitimacy of the powerful
state, and the IO only if the disciplinary measures are effective, and
threaten their ability to rule domestically. There is also the option to
join the Organization established by another powerful state in the
International System. If such an option is available, something like the
order prior to the first world war, and that of the cold war will come
into being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an IO then to be successful in setting the standards of the entire
international system, all powerful states must be able to converge about
a set of common interests. In other words for an international
organization to truly standardize norms throughout the international
system all great powers must act in collaboration with one another to
reinforce agreements to avoid undermining the legitimacy of the
institution. The difficulty in achieving this is found in the fact the
dictates of the international order do not determine great power
behavior, but rather the domestic forces which challenge the authority
of its leaders do. The prime example of which is the United States war
in Iraq under President George W. Bush. Despite the protests of the UN
member states, the government was forced to act under fear of losing
popularity among its base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in highly technical and rather nonpolitical areas of international
affairs does it appear that coalitions of powerful states can manage to
converge about a set of interests. Especially is this true when it comes
to renegotiating the terms of membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hypothesis&#34; &gt;Hypothesis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hypothesis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I argue that international organizations modify the terms of
their agreements only when it is in the interest of the powerful
domestic constituencies of a coalition of powerful member states. A
state cannot go it alone at the international level, nor will it
successfully ratify the agreement if it is not in the interest of the
domestic camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-of-the-test&#34; &gt;Design of the Test
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#design-of-the-test&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I adopt the intuition of the two-level game, but avoid the calculus by
way of preferences. Instead I adopt a calculus by way of expectations.
Preferences are unbounded. Expectations however are the set of expected
outcomes bounded by law and authority. In other words, expectations are
preferences bounded by the exercise of a state&amp;rsquo;s institutions. As
institutions are expected to act in such a way as to maintain
legitimacy, their free exercise is not unbounded. As opposed to the
convergence about preferences, I expect that win-sets will converge
about a common set of expectations that arise from the internal process
of maintaining political legitimacy. To test my hypothesis then, I first
analyze the international organization. I then discern which states are
the most powerful. I then look to the issue, to see whether it is an
issue is supported by domestic coalitions of the powerful states. If
that issue is agreed upon by the most influential states within the
organization it is likely that new agreements will be signed, and the
policy of the organization will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34; &gt;Case Study
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#case-study&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition of the GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
to the World Trade Organization will serve as the case study of
analysis. I will analyze the foundations of the GATT, the basic terms
under which the states agreed to enter into the agreement. Then I will
look to the World Trade Organization, and seek to explain why the most
powerful states in the organization sought to expand the GATT and why
they agreed to the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GATT, formed after the Second World War, spearheaded by the efforts
of the United States and the United Kingdom, was the only multilateral
instrument governing international trade from 1948 until 1995 (Cite WTO
website). The point of its development was to liberalize trade and
reduce tariffs between members. Interestingly within less than a month
if its signing, the United States sought to expand the agreement to
govern all of international trade. The Havana conference of 1947 was to
do just that and to develop the International Trade Organization. The
deal proved to be incapable of ratification in the legislatures of many
member states, notable the Congress of the United States the leader of
the movement. Thus, marking the first in a series of failed attempts to
create a multilateral body regulating trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GATT however was not an unsuccessful agreement. Periodic rounds of
negotiation, and subsequent agreements expanded the jurisdiction of the
organization and granted to it greater legitimacy as the years passed.
The agreements eight round of agreements, the Uruguay Round of 1986-94
is the most instrumental as it established the World Trade Organization.
Why is it that previous attempts to develop the body failed, but in this
one instance it came into being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is ultimately answered by identifying the expectations of
the domestic structures of the most powerful states attempting to
renegotiate the deal. Or what was it that the domestic structure
pressured the leaders of the state to do? This type of analysis will
vary between states as it is dependent upon the institutional
organization of the state. To simplify the process for this analysis, I
look primarily to who is responsible for ratifying the trade deal, and
who is it they are responsible to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most powerful states at the time of the creation of the World Trade
Organization were in order the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Brazil, and then Spain.[2] I
can further reduce the important states to the United States, the
European Union, Japan, and Canada, collectively known as the quad, as
they together account for most of international trade and the largest
share of international GDP (Databank: World Development Indicators).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States its Senate is officially responsible for the
ratification of international treaties. However, due to legislative
enactments the process of ratification at the time the Uruguay rounds
was modified to require a majority vote in each of house of its Congress
and the approval of the President. The President and his staff were
responsible for the negotiation of the deal. Thus, the expectations to
analyze are those of the constituencies which the members of the
Congress and president rely on for appointment to their office. This
differs between each group and is thus a very difficult process to
determine. It is dependent upon the perceptions of the Congressman, and
the advice of their most important allies. They will vote for a deal
only if it is perceived to be a political win. A thorough analysis would
require reviewing the vote of each senator and then inferring the
constituents responsible for their appointment and the expectations of
each group. As this is untenable, reviewing the actions of the president
is actually a valid point of view to determine the aggregate
expectations of those within the domestic structure as the ratification
of the bill is dependent upon their support. Thus, the president is
negotiating on their behalf. (Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. Chapter 12);
(U.S. Constitution, Article 1 Sect. 3); (U.S. Constitution, Amendment
17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is comprised of a very different political structure
of hierarchal authority. Individual states do not negotiate trade deals.
Rather the European Commission comprised of appointed members negotiate
deals on the behalf of the entire union. These deals must be approved by
the European Parliament which is comprised of elected representatives
from each of the members states, but the ultimate power to ratify the
agreements falls with the council. Members of the council are the heads
of state each EU member state. Their position in power is dependent upon
the domestic structures of their individual states. Nonetheless, when
bargaining internationally, they are doing so in order to maintain their
position as leader. Thus, they will not agree to a deal that will
compromise their domestic coalitions. (The European Council, 2018); (The
European Parliament: About Parliament).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese &amp;ldquo;Diet&amp;rdquo;, the state&amp;rsquo;s version of parliament is responsible
for the ratification of treaties and international trade deals. The
executive cabinet is solely responsible for the negotiation of the deals
aided by its bureaucracy. However, as Japan is a parliamentary state,
unlike the United States, the prime minister, the executive of the
country, possesses almost free ability to institute law. This is due to
party discipline, and the fact that as the head of the government, the
prime minister is also the head of the party in possession of the
majority seats in the parliament. What then the executive negotiates
will most likely be passed. There is surely an internal bargaining
process, but it is not as crucial to the process as that of the United
States. (Fundamental Structure of the Government of Japan, 2007);
(Structure of the National Diet, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada is also structured around a Parliamentary government. The
executive committee like that of japan is centered around the prime
minister. The prime minister and his cabinet negotiate the trade deals
and then put it to parliament for ratification. The same rules of party
discipline apply here as in Japan. The likelihood of a trade deal
negotiated by the executive cabinet being ratified is very high.
(Parliamentary Primer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my hypothesis then, these states will renegotiate the GATT
agreements when it is in the domestic interests of the heads of states
responsible for the ratification of the trade deal. The most difficult
state to accomplish in would be the United States as the greatest number
of individuals are responsible for ratification. And, because the
possible domestic win-set is the smallest in relationship to the other
powers. It is then expected that the United States will find it most
difficult to ratify the World Trade Organization agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected the Quad States (United States, Canada, Japan, EU) were by
far the most important states involved in the process of negotiation.
Their economic power and political clout were necessary to develop an
international organization with actual effect on international trade.
Thus, the states with economic value were essentially ignored in this
process. (VanGrasstek, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratification of the deals also depended on the perceptions of the
domestic coalitions of states engaged in talks. Dispute resolutions,
agricultural subsidies, and auto tariffs were the most contentious
issues between the Quad. Each sate feared primarily the delegitimizing
their domestic governments. The United States and the EU for instance
disputed over pork tariffs seriously enough to threaten the deal
outright. The United States senators and the president were concerned
that a deal that lifted subsidies would put a large number of their
constituencies out of a job. If this were to occur they thought their
positions of authority would be compromised. (VanGrasstek, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to the problem came about in the form of substantial
dispute resolution mechanisms to solve the enforcement problem. The
United States as the most influential member of the organization most
likely assumed that it could use the Dispute Settlement Body to its own
end. The other states in the system perceived it to be capable enough to
bind the United States to internationally agreed to norms and
consensuses on trade. The goal of course to put an end to politically
disruptive tariff spikes targeted at politically relevant sectors of
economies. Or in other words to regulate international trade in order to
put an end to trade wards. This to all states at the time seemed to be
vital to securing the domestic expectations of their constituencies. The
intent of all measures is to ensure a domestic win at the time of
signing, but also to ensure ongoing win-sets across time (Fearon, 1998).
The World Trade Organization embodies that it is inherently an
organization designed to satisfy the demands of the members states not
to act as an independent body. (VanGrasstek, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding when international organizations likely to modify their
agreements, they appear to do so when a coalition of powerful states can
agree to do so. Such a straightforward answer to the question seems
obvious however, in the process of research many questions arose as to
if this is actually true. I began this research from an entirely
different point of view. I sought to answer whether Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGO) could influence Inter-Governmental organization to
adopt new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to that question led me to study states as opposed NGO&amp;rsquo;s
because in order for an NGO to influence an IGO powerful states must be
recruited to the cause. The global civil society literature is fairly
adamant about this. Thus, I led astray from studying only NGO&amp;rsquo;s and
instead sought to understand why states may modify existing IGO&amp;rsquo;s or
develop new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States are a far more interesting unit of analyses as all forms of
influence within the state could be studied to determine if domestic
politics really does lead to international politics. To this I would say
that there is no doubt that international politics begins at home. The
Logic of the Two Level Game cannot be ignored. Leaders dependent upon
domestic coalitions must act accordingly to realize their expectations
or risk losing office. From this one could see how domestic perceptions
of economic conditions, human rights, or any other issue can influence a
state&amp;rsquo;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when approaching IGO&amp;rsquo;s and the forces which influence their
operation, not only is it more interesting look to states, but also far
more functional than attempting to discern the influence of NGO&amp;rsquo;s
operating within states. Such an analysis requires testimony from policy
makers, meeting minutes, extensive media analysis, and a harmonious
relationship with an NGO, an IGO, and a state bureaucracy. Frankly
speaking these resources were not available, nor was I able to establish
contact with any of the important players. Therefore, one had to default
to observation from the point of view of a neutral observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In so doing it became evident that states, whether one likes it or not,
solely possess the legal authority and material capability to influence
IGO&amp;rsquo;s. Civil society on the other hand, while influential, is without
the authority or means to actually bring about legitimate change.
Institutions trusted by citizens, or even possibly willed into being by
military force, are those with the legitimate power to actually enforce
laws and norms. As such, I adopted Dahl&amp;rsquo;s intuition into decision making
that institutions with legal authority regulate and standardize decision
making procedures and also patterns of influence. These institutions are
the field in which those seeking to acquire influence play, and
therefore adapt to the rules. Without then needing to further delve into
this process I chose to instead analyze relationships between states, as
opposed to analyzing the operations of NGO&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is in need of expansion however in one crucial category. It
assumes wholeheartedly that the leaders of states are entirely dependent
on the whims of their domestic coalitions and that they are incapable of
employing any tactics to manipulate them. A new research project that
explores the topic in depth is in need. To make the assumption that the
preferences of influential leaders do not play a role in international
politics is too great a pill to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When do International Organizations renegotiate the terms of their
agreements? They do so when powerful states within the organization
compel it do so. The logic of the Two-Level game though indicates that
the process is dependent on the expectations of domestic coalitions.
Also, the relative power between states makes it so that only a minority
of powerful states are actually important when attempting to renegotiate
deals. A win-set is achieved when the expectations of the domestic
coalitions of the most relevant states converge about a deal. The
transition of the GATT to the World Trade Organization as case study
demonstrates this process. The Quad states, the most relevant state in
the international economy Rather, it is apparent that the need for
politicians to maintain their domestic coalitions was more important to
the calculus of the leaders than the acquisition of power or wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
