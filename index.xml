&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#le-bonheur&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music.  The poetry.  The stills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this film haunts me.  Pastels.  Mozart.  Yello.  Blue.  Red. Green.  Temptation.  Fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments and words.  Colors and music.  I can not process the barrage of sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man in love.  A wife loving.  A mistress tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of his wife.  His remarriage.  Children calling another women mother.  Emilie a woman  Emilie a danseur.  Emilie a mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wife.  Traditional.  Hard working.  Caring.  She cooks.  She sews.  She permits she husband to do as he pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, a man.  Beautiful man.  Tall, dark, handsome.  Rugged, to a degree.  A carpenter, always well dressed and well mannered.  Joyous without fail.  He loves his wife.  he loves his children.  He loves his mistress.  He loves his nephews.  He loves his uncle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loves everything.  He is too perfect.  Too beautiful  He is the epitome of mascuinity demonstrating the tenderness of a poet.  A man that works with his manicured hands.  A man that crosses his lefs to sip tea from blue china.  He dances.  He is good in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We experience death.  We dissasociate from the hell of that moment.  The yellows shift to blue.  The wife embraced.  Cold and drowned.  Music ceases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family mourns. Family cries.  Man visits his beauty to secure a place within her memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post card, Black and white.  Emptiness withouth a woman.  Color fades to grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return.  The embrace.  The invitation.  The acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music begins.  Love is made.  Emilie, mistress, mother, wife, lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding hands marching towards the future.  A death of tradition to embrace the temptation of an engaging wife. Equal to men in her proclivity for love and her breadth of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ophelia drowned clutching the flowers near the pond to be forgotten by family she once loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horrifying is the personal experience of death.  It passes on with the coldness of time.  This is how it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more to the film than nihilism.  Emilie, I love her too.  Emilie a social being.  A woman with an identity of her own.  Possibly a blank state that can create her existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, she marries.  That independent identity becomes a part of a family.  Though, a we embracing with hands held and feet on the ground.  Independent nodes of being linked together by the common experience.  A fair compromise to femininity and independence, love, and biology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Washington Avenue</title>
      <link>https://notebook.jnapolitano.io/posts/washington-avenue/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, a cigarette.  Relief.  Immediate relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work.  Pretend to be a profesional.  Write a post.   Act like an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know a thing.  I take an interview. I am too honest.  I tell the truth.  I express my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You speak to me.  I listen.  Your questions are pointless.  I do not care about your company.  I do not really care about your product.  I want a job to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so simple.  I want my paycheck.  I want to pay rent.  I want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife works.  I drink coffee.  I write a post.  I justify my day.  I return home.  I watch tv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I strolled.  I walked the avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men.  Three of them approahced.  Three of them left confused.  Do not move. Do not speak.  Breathe slowly.  Walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cigarettes.  I do not want to be here.  Another smoke to fit in.  Washington Avenue.  Houston.  The crowd waiting to enter a dirty room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lonliness is hell. A cigarette is death.  Die to avoid being alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk the avenue.  Breathe.  Return home.  Turn on the tv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still walk with fear.  An insecure gait.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;objects-and-identity&#34; &gt;Objects and Identity
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#objects-and-identity&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am looking at myself.  I feel the weave of my woolen pants.  The gold and blue and black threads interweave to produce a cacoon for my pale legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel confident.  I feel comfortable.  I may not be a large man. I am not the smartest; nor strongest.  Yet, I feel well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small aesthetic things produce a positive impression. My red hankerchief accompanying a matching outfit.  A perfectly cut fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boots.  Leather boots.  I feel steady when I wear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety affects me more than it used to.  I think about things.  I used to just do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man should carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad told me to just ignore the bullshit.  To focus on what is important.  General lack of meaning and purpose is painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still attempt to find truth and reason in why I do the things I do.  I read a solution to the problem once. Submit. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, one can create their identity.  Society etches her identity in to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not believe in God.  I ask him for help to get out of bed.  I rationalize it away as a fear response.  Mother Mary laughs from the chain around my neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I experienced death she stood by me in the room.  Watching over my body as it descended into death.  I survived.  She is no longer with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drink my coffee.  Starbucks brand.  I feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been creating professional blogs and websites to showcase my talents.  I&amp;rsquo;m tired of that.  Notebook, will be a place that will alow me to just write what is on my mind, to collect my ideas, and publish personal articles.&lt;/p&gt;
